# Frontend Development Projects Based on Angela Yu's Course

This repository contains my personal solutions and projects based on the concepts learned in [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. 

The code here is **my own work**, inspired by the exercises and concepts from the course. While some of these projects may reflect course topics, they are not direct copies of the course exercises. I have applied my own understanding and expanded upon the ideas presented in the course.

## Usage

I made the repo largely for myself, so I am not sure if one will find it useful‚ò∫Ô∏è
I can't think of anybody reading that code except for a reason: "Hey, what are onter junior devs doingüôÉ".
So if you find some usfull info there, goodüòé But most likely you won'y get much out of itüôà
